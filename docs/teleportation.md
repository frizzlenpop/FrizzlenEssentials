- **Location History**: Return to previous locations with the `/back` command
- **Cooldowns and Delays**: Configurable cooldowns and delays for balanced gameplay
- **World Teleportation**: Teleport between different worlds
- **Death Location**: Return to your last death location
- **Highest Block**: Teleport to the highest block at your current XZ coordinates
- **Upward Teleportation**: Go up a specified number of blocks

## Configuration Options

In the `config.yml` file, you can customize the teleportation system with the following options:

```yaml
teleportation:
  # Cooldown in seconds between teleportations
  cooldown: 3
  
  # Delay in seconds before teleportation (set to 0 for instant teleportation)
  delay: 3
  
  # Whether to cancel teleportation when the player moves during the delay
  cancel-on-move: true
  
  # Maximum time in seconds a teleport request stays active
  request-timeout: 60
  
  # Whether to save player's last location when they teleport
  save-last-location: true
  
  # Maximum back locations to save per player
  max-back-locations: 5
```

### Basic Permissions

- `frizzlenessentials.up.unlimited` - Allows teleporting upward with no distance limit

## Usage Examples

### Teleport Requests

1. Player Alex wants to teleport to Player Steve:
   - Alex types: `/tpa Steve`
   - Steve receives a message asking to accept or deny
   - If Steve types `/tpaccept`, Alex is teleported to Steve
   - If Steve types `/tpdeny` or doesn't respond within the timeout period, the request is canceled

### Returning to Previous Locations

1. Player uses any teleportation command to move to a new location
2. The player can use `/back` to return to their previous location
3. This is particularly useful after death, allowing players to quickly return to where they were

### Using the Top Command

The `/top` command is useful for quickly getting to the surface when underground:
1. Player is deep underground while mining
2. Player types `/top`
3. Player is instantly teleported to the highest block at their current X,Z coordinates

### Using the Up Command

The `/up` command allows players to quickly build platforms or reach higher locations:
1. Player is building a structure and needs to work on a higher level
2. Player types `/up 5`
3. Player is teleported 5 blocks upward and a glass block is placed beneath them

## Notes

- Teleport requests expire after the configured timeout period
- Players can only have one active teleport request at a time
- Using `/back` multiple times lets you traverse through your location history
- The `/top` command will only teleport you upwards, never downwards
- The `/up` command will place a glass block beneath you, ensuring you don't fall
