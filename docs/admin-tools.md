   - Type `/pweather clear` to set your weather to clear

2. Manage player status:
   - Type `/kill Steve` to kill a player

   - With the appropriate permissions, you can also modify the items
   - Type `/endersee Alex` to view Alex's ender chest contents

## Notes

- Administrative commands are logged to the console if enabled in the configuration
- The `/vanish` command has multiple options to control interaction and visibility
- Player-specific time and weather settings do not affect other players
- The `/sudo` command cannot be used on players with the `frizzlenessentials.sudo.exempt` permission
- Inventory viewing and editing is a powerful tool and should be granted only to trusted administrators
- Server performance commands like `/gc` should be used sparingly
